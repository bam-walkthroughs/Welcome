## An introduction to BAM Walkthroughs

#### Who we are...

We are a group of full stack developers, who not too long ago were a hodge podge of folks who knew nothing about development. We are aiming to help anyone interested in development learn, step-by-step through a series of walkthroughs. Our reasoning behind this is simple, we like to talk about code. Code is something we get excited about, and in our eagerness we wanted to share our knowledge with the world. AKA, you benefit from us being super stoked about pounding out code. When we undertake a project, we are sure to add the code and a detailed walkthrough to BAM Walkthroughs. 

The walkthroughs have descriptions of what you are doing, why you are doing and code snippets. ** We highly encourage you to type out the code, not copy/paste it. ** If you actually want to be a developer get used to typing code. We promise all of our code is done cleanly, so emulate our style and you should be ok.
